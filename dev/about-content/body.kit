            HOW MANY OF US HAVE EITHER JOKINGLY, OR SERIOUSLY, BEGGED FOR RECIPROCATION AFTER SUCH A VULNERABLE EXPRESSION?
        </p>
        <p>
            FOR SOME REASON, THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT RESONATED WITH ME.
        </p>
        <p>
            I STARED AT THE TEXT CONVERSATION ON MY SCREEN,
        </p>
        <p>
            “SAY IT BACK”<br>“LOVE YOU”
        </p>
        <p>
            I DOVE INTO THE SIMPLISTIC BEAUTY OF NOT WANTING TO END A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SAYING “I LOVE YOU.”
    . . . BUT ALSO THE DEEP, PROFOUND, COMPLEXITY OF NOT WANTING TO END A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SAYING “I LOVE YOU.”
        </p>
        <p>
            IN WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A “LIGHTBULB MOMENT” THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS COMMON INTERACTION HIT ME LIKE A TRAIN, AND I KNEW WE NEEDED TO USE IT AS THE SLOGAN FOR THE CLOTHING BRAND I WAS STARTING.
        </p>
        <p>
            SO I MESSAGED MY BUSINESS PARTER,
        </p>
        <p>
            “I LOVE YOU, SAY IT BACK. THAT SHOULD BE OUR SAYING.”
        </p>
        <p>
            AND IN WHAT HE COULD ALSO ONLY DESCRIBE AS A LIGHTBULB MOMENT, HE REPLIED IN ALL CAPS,
        </p>
        <p>
            “YES.”
        </p>

            BACK IN 2017,  THERE WAS A TREND OF ONLINE CREATORS WITH CULT LIKE FOLLOWINGS, MAKING AND SELLING “MERCH” LIKE YOU’D BUY FOR YOUR FAVORITE BAND AFTER A CONCERT. THIS WAS NEW AT THE TIME, AND EVEN CONTROVERSIAL IN A WAY, FOR CREATORS TO CROSS OVER INTO THIS SPACE THAT WAS EXCLUSIVE TO “REAL” CELEBRITIES. SELLING T-SHIRTS WITH YOUR FACE PRINTED ON THE FRONT? ONLY ROCKSTARS AND NEPOTISM BABIES WERE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
        </p>
        <p>
            BUT WHILE CRINGEY TO SOME PEOPLE, IT STILL WORKED.
        </p>
        <p>
            BECAUSE POP STAR OR YOUTUBER, IT DIDN’T MATTER. THE REASON PEOPLE BUY SHIRTS AFTER CONCERTS IS STILL THE SAME.
        </p>
        <p>
            THEY WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE APART OF SOMETHING BIGGER.
        </p>
        <p>
            SO HERE I WAS WITH THIS PLATFORM AND THIS LOYAL AUDIENCE, I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING WITH IT. I LOVED FASHION, BUT I KNEW THAT I WASN’T A DESIGNER. I ALSO KNEW THAT I HAD ZERO EXPERIENCE IN BUSINESS, AND NOT A CLUE WHERE TO START.
        </p>
        <p>
            ENTER, BRONSON. DESIGNER/BUSINESS GUY.
        </p>
        <p>
            AND SO MY DEARS, THE LEGEND HAS IT,
        </p>
        <p>
            THIS IS HOW LONELY GHOST WAS BORN.
