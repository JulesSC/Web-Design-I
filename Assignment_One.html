<p>The site I want to rebrand is one of my favorite clothing brands titled <em>Lonely Ghost</em>. The company has incredible brand vision but is unfortunately disorganized it&#8217;s web presence. In which case, using their base categorization, images, and most likely color scheme, I plan to redesign their site into a more fitting, user friendly layout.</p>

<p>Beginning witht the inspiration:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://morgvus.tumblr.com/">morgvus</a>

<ul>
<li>What I really enjoy about this site is the sporatic layout of the images. They vary in both placement and size which brings a personalized, dynamic feel to site. I think replicating a similar layout when organizing the product section of <em>Lonely Ghost</em> would be advantageous.</li>
<li>The infitinity scroll would instead be broken up into designated pages and obviously the menu on the current site is practically ineffective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.justinsloane.com/">justinsalone</a>

<ul>
<li>I really enjoy the use of type int he site, I think <em>Lonely Ghost</em> has some bold typographic options that could eb really fun to play with. Particuarly in relation to their, at times funky, color scheme.</li>
<li>Especially when designing for mobile, the split screen layout will not work, theres a need for more space and the ability to breathe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://visualjournal.it/">visualjournal</a>

<ul>
<li>Again the layout is enjoyable, I find myself most intriguided by the product spot light layout. The aside is a creative touch adn again, while I wonder if the space on a mobile screen would permit such, the organization is tasteful.</li>
<li>The lack of text defintiely dedacts from the user friendly aspect of the site and the menu is minimal. Both would have to be modified to better guide the user through the content.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="contentinventory">Content Inventory</h2>

<p>Current Sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shop</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Ambassador</li>
</ul>

<p>Revised Sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shop

<ul>
<li>Tops</li>
<li>Bottoms</li>
<li>Outerwear</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
<li>Partnerships</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the brand identity of the company is fanominal however, the content they produce is disorganized in a detrimental fashion. The <em>shop</em> tab needs to be categorized in terms of product, the <em>events</em> tab should be moved up in priority, the <em>blog</em> can follow and <em>music</em> can be replaced by contact. While the option to reccomend music is important adn will be encorporated elsewhere int he site, the option to contact the company needs to be front and center. Whether your a partner looking to reach out or a fan hoping to connect, having the companies contact information blatantly displayed is a neceessity.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to structure all of the <em>Lonely Ghost</em> content in this file as the product range is fairly expansive and would include the incorporation of a mutlitude of images. While most of the pages referenced will be easily fixed, I do plan on cutting down the image use simply to make the rebranding of the site more concise and easier to manage.</strong></p>
