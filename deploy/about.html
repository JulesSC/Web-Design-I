                <h2><span>ABOUT</span> LONELY GHOST</h2>
                <p>
                    THREE YEARS AGO, I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY ON AGAIN/OFF AGAIN BOYFRIEND. WE WERE IN OUR “OFF AGAIN” STAGE, WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF WHY I HUNG UP THE PHONE SO ABRUPTLY ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT.
                    I COULDN’T TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID THAT MADE ME SO UPSET, BUT ALL I KNOW IS, HE ENDED THE CALL WITH AN “I LOVE YOU” AND I REPLIED WITH A “SEE YA!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A MERE THREE SECONDS AFTER HANGING UP, MY PHONE LIT UP WITH A NOTIFICATION. A TEXT FROM JACKSON.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “SAY IT BACK”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT. I DIDN’T SAY “I LOVE YOU” BEFORE I HUNG UP. AND NO MATTER WHERE WE WERE AT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP…WE TOOK “SAYING IT BACK” VERY SERIOUSLY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I TEXTED BACK, “LOVE YOU” BECAUSE I WAS STILL FEELING TOO PETTY FOR THE FULL SENTENCE, BUT IT WAS A SWEET MOMENT. AND A UNIVERSAL ONE, I THOUGHT.
                </p>

    <section id="content">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        HOW MANY OF US HAVE EITHER JOKINGLY, OR SERIOUSLY, BEGGED FOR RECIPROCATION AFTER SUCH A VULNERABLE EXPRESSION?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FOR SOME REASON, THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT RESONATED WITH ME.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I STARED AT THE TEXT CONVERSATION ON MY SCREEN,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “SAY IT BACK”<br>“LOVE YOU”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I DOVE INTO THE SIMPLISTIC BEAUTY OF NOT WANTING TO END A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SAYING “I LOVE YOU.”
                . . . BUT ALSO THE DEEP, PROFOUND, COMPLEXITY OF NOT WANTING TO END A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SAYING “I LOVE YOU.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IN WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A “LIGHTBULB MOMENT” THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS COMMON INTERACTION HIT ME LIKE A TRAIN, AND I KNEW WE NEEDED TO USE IT AS THE SLOGAN FOR THE CLOTHING BRAND I WAS STARTING.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SO I MESSAGED MY BUSINESS PARTER,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I LOVE YOU, SAY IT BACK. THAT SHOULD BE OUR SAYING.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AND IN WHAT HE COULD ALSO ONLY DESCRIBE AS A LIGHTBULB MOMENT, HE REPLIED IN ALL CAPS,
                    </p>
                    <p id="above">
                        “YES.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        BACK IN 2017,  THERE WAS A TREND OF ONLINE CREATORS WITH CULT LIKE FOLLOWINGS, MAKING AND SELLING “MERCH” LIKE YOU’D BUY FOR YOUR FAVORITE BAND AFTER A CONCERT. THIS WAS NEW AT THE TIME, AND EVEN CONTROVERSIAL IN A WAY, FOR CREATORS TO CROSS OVER INTO THIS SPACE THAT WAS EXCLUSIVE TO “REAL” CELEBRITIES. SELLING T-SHIRTS WITH YOUR FACE PRINTED ON THE FRONT? ONLY ROCKSTARS AND NEPOTISM BABIES WERE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BUT WHILE CRINGEY TO SOME PEOPLE, IT STILL WORKED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BECAUSE POP STAR OR YOUTUBER, IT DIDN’T MATTER. THE REASON PEOPLE BUY SHIRTS AFTER CONCERTS IS STILL THE SAME.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        THEY WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE APART OF SOMETHING BIGGER.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SO HERE I WAS WITH THIS PLATFORM AND THIS LOYAL AUDIENCE, I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING WITH IT. I LOVED FASHION, BUT I KNEW THAT I WASN’T A DESIGNER. I ALSO KNEW THAT I HAD ZERO EXPERIENCE IN BUSINESS, AND NOT A CLUE WHERE TO START.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ENTER, BRONSON. DESIGNER/BUSINESS GUY.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AND SO MY DEARS, THE LEGEND HAS IT,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        THIS IS HOW LONELY GHOST WAS BORN.
