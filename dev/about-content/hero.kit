        <p>
            THREE YEARS AGO, I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY ON AGAIN/OFF AGAIN BOYFRIEND. WE WERE IN OUR “OFF AGAIN” STAGE, WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF WHY I HUNG UP THE PHONE SO ABRUPTLY ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT.
            I COULDN’T TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID THAT MADE ME SO UPSET, BUT ALL I KNOW IS, HE ENDED THE CALL WITH AN “I LOVE YOU” AND I REPLIED WITH A “SEE YA!”
        </p>
        <p>
            A MERE THREE SECONDS AFTER HANGING UP, MY PHONE LIT UP WITH A NOTIFICATION. A TEXT FROM JACKSON.
        </p>
        <p>
            “SAY IT BACK”
        </p>
        <p>
            I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT. I DIDN’T SAY “I LOVE YOU” BEFORE I HUNG UP. AND NO MATTER WHERE WE WERE AT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP…WE TOOK “SAYING IT BACK” VERY SERIOUSLY.
        </p>
        <p>
            I TEXTED BACK, “LOVE YOU” BECAUSE I WAS STILL FEELING TOO PETTY FOR THE FULL SENTENCE, BUT IT WAS A SWEET MOMENT. AND A UNIVERSAL ONE, I THOUGHT.
